Comp Robot:
    - automatically face hub in auto
    - add layouts and really organize every motor position and velocity in advantage scope
    - kicker class 
        - run PID on velocity rather than power for more consistant shots
    - figure out the intake motor issue
    - slow mode over bump - dont always slow just cap velocity
    - on teleop (and maybe auto?) enable set goal heading to current heading so it doesnt spin out
    - look into elastic 
    - turning mode for the shot to turn up/down the speed
    - rename lower current limits to set so you can add argument for the currents

Copilot
    - shuttle position buttons
    - jiggle intake while shooting
