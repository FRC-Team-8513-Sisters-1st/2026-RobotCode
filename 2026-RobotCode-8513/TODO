Comp Robot:
    - kicker class - run PID on velocity rather than power for more consistant shots
    - look into elastic 
        x match countdown
        x end of inactive/active
        x add shot positions
        - photon vision status lights
    x rename lower current limits to set so you can add argument for the currents
    x use/don't use vision toggle
    x add motor currents and pid editing for all subsystems

Copilot
    x shuttle position buttons
    - jiggle intake while shooting 
    x force indexer to start and stop and reverse --> while holding
    x FIX if not in zone then copilot seelcted shuttle pose
    x spin intake in or out
    - manual bring intake up a little while shooting



Driver
    - align to hub button should autodrive


Tuning Joystick
    x tuning mode for the shot to turn up/down the speed and hood (NEW BRANCH - manualShooterTuning)
    x manual turn on all the mechanisms
    x indexer current limits on dash


Get Robot Schedule:
    - check all Ids
    - test no vision odometry (tune path following pid)
    - set offsets for cameras, import the config, accurate vision pose?
    - tune pid values for subsystems
    - test all the buttons and manual controls (update fudge factors)
    - set real values for the velocities (going over bump, driving while shooting)
    - check hood position + that it updates
    - tune shot (set values for the interpolation)
    - check angle for hub shooting and bump
    - test + tune autos
    - clean tele drive if needed



shot tuning: dist: 2.05, v: 39 pos: .3
