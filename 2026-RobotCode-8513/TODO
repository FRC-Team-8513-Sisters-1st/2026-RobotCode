Comp Robot:
    - automatically face hub in auto
    - add layouts and really organize every motor position and velocity in advantage scope
    - kicker class 
        - run PID on velocity rather than power for more consistant shots
    - figure out the intake motor issue
    - slow mode over bump - dont always slow just cap velocity
    - on teleop (and maybe auto?) enable set goal heading to current heading so it doesnt spin out
    - button to snap to nearest 0 or 180 degree heading to go over bump
    - look into elastic 
    - use the lowered current limit
    - turning mode for the shot to turn up/down the speed

Copilot
    - shuttle position buttons
    - jiggle intake while shooting 

Driver
    - snake mode 
    - straighten to go over bump (auto drive over bump)
    - fix go over bump speed
